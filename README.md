I only recently decided to make a Github, because I thought it would be nice to have a place to put up all the coding work that I have ever done that was not Google Drive. (Since that isn't accessible, or nicely formatted for coding I think.)
I don't know how to do a lot of things with computers, not because I'm a luddite or anything like that - I never learned. But I will try now!
